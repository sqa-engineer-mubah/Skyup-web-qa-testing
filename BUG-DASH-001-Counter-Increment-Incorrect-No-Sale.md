Bug ID: TW-REC-002
Title: Duplicate or missing sales rep records generated in Turn With flow

Environment:

Module: Dashboard (Turn With Feature)
Browser: Chrome
OS: Windows 11

Description:
In the Turn With workflow, system inconsistently creates duplicate records for the same sales representative. In some cases, only one record is created, and in "no sale" scenarios, the Turn With rep is incorrectly added to the list instead of the actual user.

Steps to Reproduce:

Login as System Admin
Start a Turn With session
Complete flow without making a sale
Check records in Sales Rep table

Expected Result:

Only one record should be created per transaction
No-sale case should not insert invalid or unintended records
Correct sales representative should be reflected

Actual Result:

Duplicate records appear randomly OR only one record is created inconsistently
In no-sale scenario, Turn With rep is added instead of actual sales rep

Severity: High
Priority: High
Status: Open
